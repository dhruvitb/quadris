OK ACTUALLY GET SYMBOL MIGHT HAVE A USE

Lisa pls comment:
    GamePiece.cc


WHen you restart we still need to make the held piece nullptr
We need to make holdSwapped false
Probably many other new features that we have now
Basically update the grid retart function


If you try to switch to an I block at the very right it does very bad things


If a piece is standing vertically, the hint will never tell it to go to the far right

BRICK PICE DOES NOT WORK FIX COUNT BECAUSE IT COUNTS THE BLOCK AS A DROP
