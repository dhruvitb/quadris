Level4:
    When you generate a piece you need to do:
        1. Increase the turn count
        2. Check if turn count is equal to 5:
        3. If equal to 5:
            NotifyObservers (i.e. tell the grid to drop a bomb)
            Set the turnsSinceClear 0
        4. Generate a new piece

The idea about returning true for clearing a line is a no go as it stand
(NotifyObservers will probably need to be overriden for all the classes that
use it)
