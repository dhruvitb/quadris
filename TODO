OK ACTUALLY GET SYMBOL MIGHT HAVE A USE

Lisa pls comment:
    GamePiece.cc

MAKE THE GAME REAL TIME BY ADDING A TIMER THAT ADDS TO A THING
AND THEN IT CALLS HEAVYMOVE ON THE PIECE ONCE THE TIME REACHES 50
SETS THE TIME TO 0. IF IT CALLS HEAVYMOVE AND FAILS THEN IT CALLS DROP
ON THAT PIECE!!!!!!!!!!!!


WHen you restart we still need to make the held piece nullptr
We need to make holdSwapped false
Probably many other new features that we have now
Basically update the grid retart function


If you try to switch to an I block at the very right it does very bad things
